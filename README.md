# News-sentiment-SIH19
This repo deals with a problem statement of SIH '19 (https://www.sih.gov.in/), given by the ministry of Railways, Govt. of India.

Two parts of the problem:

a) recommending an optimal newspaper for publishing an article in, given the readership and ad prices of each newspaper.

b) creating a media monitoring system, to let them know what is being circulated about Indian Railways in the media.
